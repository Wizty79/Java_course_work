/* char = charecter
   the single quotes '' are for char values, "" double quotes are for string values 
   in the first version of the code we wrote $char name = 'Jenna'
   you can use that or String, however char consumes less memory 
   char is a primitive data type, where String is an object
   so rule is:
   use char to store single character
   use String to store larger text
